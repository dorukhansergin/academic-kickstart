Greetings! Welcome to my personal website where you can find a snapshot of my past as well as my ideas about things that are in the form of blog posts.

I am a PhD student at the School of Computing, Information and Decision Systems Engineering at Arizona State University. There, I spend a typical day learning, teaching and creating things; mostly related to machine learning. I can define myself with three aspects of my life: what I love doing for work, what I love doing outside work and what problems I care about the most.

For work, I love building systems that consumes data and transforms it into informed decisions. I feel particularly happy that I chose to become and industrial engineer, for that I'm exposed to three important tools to make this happen: operations research, simulation and statistics. I had a chance to do research on each and every one of them as well as all the great courses I've took from amazing scholars.

Outside of work, I try to be in nature as much as I can, particularly on some body of water. I've been sailing for as long as I can remember and believe it or not, I still keep doing it in the middle of this desert called Arizona.

On a daily basis, I keep informed and involved in a number of problems which I think is of uttermost importance for my generation and the ones that will come after:

- How can we prevent and reverse climate change and environmental pollution?
- How can we design and economic system that is just and sustainable?
- How can we know and realize ourselves?

I hope you enjoy your time here and please don't hesitate to contact me should you want to talk about anything!
